	/* GetContent is the main function here. First, it resets the following values:
	 * 		playerLines: the dictionary<string, int> that contains what a player says and what index that leads to
	 * 		showContinueButton: whether or not the NPC has more to say before the player can chime in
	 * 		showPlayerLine: what the player can say to the NPC
	 * 		whereTo: -1 is a flag value that means clicking on the "next" button will simply advance the conversation by 1.
	 * 			If AllowContinue(int x) is called, -1 will be replaced by x, which will take the conversation to a different
	 * 			place than the next index.
	 * 
	 */

	// this is the string the NPC will say
	string toContent;



	// allow progression to next conversation index
	void AllowContinue () {
		showContinueButton = true;
	}

	// jump to a special index
	void AllowContinue (int where) {
		showContinueButton = true;
		whereTo = where;
	}

	void AllowPlayerLines () {
		showPlayerLine = true;
	}

	// HOW TO USE
	// 1. toContent = what the NPC will say.
	// 2a. If the player is allowed to progress to the next line without any choice, call AllowContinue() or AllowContinue(int where).
	// 2b. If the player has something to say, call AllowPlayerLines() and then create:
	// 		Dictionary<string, int> playerLines = new Dictionary<string, int>() { ... };
	// 		where each string is the player dialogue choice and each int is the corresponding index of the NPC's response
	// 3. If the NPC is to be interrupted, call Interrupt (gameObject interrupter, int lineInterrupterSays); on the relevant case.
	//		Make sure to set conversationIndex on the other character to the one you want them to start out with when you speak with them next.
